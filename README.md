# MNIST_ML_Image_Classifier: Deep Learning Handwritten Digit Recognition

Hey there! üëã I am Francis Okorie Iyeke-Kanu, and this is my implementation of a production-ready Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for handwritten digit recognition. I used the MNIST dataset to create a model that can accurately identify handwritten digits from 0-9.

## What Makes This Project Special
I did not just build a basic model - I went the extra mile to make it production-ready with comprehensive evaluation, visualizations, and deployment features. This is a real-world application.

## Key Features
- **Smart CNN Architecture**: Custom neural network for handwritten digit recognition
- **Robust Data Pipeline**: Smooth data loading and preprocessing
- **Training with Style**: Early stopping and validation monitoring
- **Deep Analysis**: Comprehensive error patterns and model behavior analysis
- **Visual Storytelling**: Training curves, confusion matrices, and predictions
- **Production Ready**: Complete deployment pipeline

## Results
- **Test Accuracy**: 95.23% - Pretty solid!
- **Training Time**: ~10 minutes (5 epochs)
- **Model Size**: 7,184 parameters - Efficient and lightweight
- **Architecture**: 2 Conv2D layers + 2 MaxPool2D layers + Dense layers
